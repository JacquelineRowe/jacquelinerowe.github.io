I am a first-year PhD Student in the UKRI-funded <a href='https://www.responsiblenlp.org/'> CDT in Designing Responsible Natural Language Processing</a> at the University of Edinburgh. With a background in Linguistics, Human Rights Law and Computer Science, I'm interested in how to design NLP tools to be safer, fairer and more equitable for speakers of minority languages. I'm supervised by Alexandra Birch and Shannon Vallor.

Current research interests:  
- multilingual bias detection in LLMs
- hate speech detection for low-resource languages
- low-resource machine translation
- "responsibility" in NLP research

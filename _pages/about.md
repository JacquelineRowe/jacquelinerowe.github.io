I am a PhD Student in the UKRI-funded <a href='https://www.responsiblenlp.org/'> CDT in Designing Responsible Natural Language Processing</a> at the University of Edinburgh (2024-2028), supervised by Alexandra Birch and Shannon Vallor. With a background in Linguistics, Human Rights Law and Computer Science, I'm interested in how to design NLP tools to be safer, fairer and more equitable for speakers of minority languages. 

Current research interests include multilingual bias detection in LLMs, hate speech detection for low-resource languages, low-resource machine translation and linguistic equity in NLP research and technologies
